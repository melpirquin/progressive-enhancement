  <h2>The story</h2>
  <p name="Alan Watts" class="human" job="farmer" nationality="chinese" >

    Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said, <q class="they">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said,
    <q class="farmer"> Maybe.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, <q class="they">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q class="farmer"> Maybe.</q>

    The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said, <q class="they">Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">bad</span> ,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer">Maybe</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="they">
    Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer"> Maybe.</q>

    The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span>  or <span class="bad">bad</span>   <blockquote>— because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span>  fortune.

  <h3>Conclusion </h3>
  <p>
    Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...
