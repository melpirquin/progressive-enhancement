      <div class="main-box" style="width: 90%">
        <blockquote>
          <p class="three">Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
    That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.They said,</p><q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away.
  This is most unfortunate.</q> <p class="three">The farmer said,</p> <q><em>maybe</em>.</q>
          <p class="three">The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,</p>
  <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q><p class="three">The farmer again said,</p>  <q><em>maybe</em>.</q>
          <p class="three">The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
            The neighbors then said,</p>  <q>Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> <p class="three">and the farmer responded,</p> <q><em>maybe</em>.</q>
          <p class="three">The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army,
            and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,</p>
  <q>Isn’t that great!</q><p class="three"> Again, he said,</p> <q><em>maybe</em>.</q>
          <p class="three">The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,
            and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad</p>

  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p class="two">Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
