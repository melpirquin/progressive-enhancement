<h4>The story</h4>


<div class="text">
  Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away.
  That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate.They said, <q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away.
  This is most unfortunate.</q> The farmer said, <q><em>maybe</em>.</q>
  The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
  <q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said, <q><em>maybe</em>.</q>
  The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.
  The neighbors then said, <q>Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <q><em>maybe</em>.</q>
  The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army,
  and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said,
  <q>Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q><em>maybe</em>.</q>
  The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity,
  and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is good or bad<br>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>Good and Bad are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
